"1. Census Bureau midyear population estimate. BEA produced intercensal annual county population statistics for 2010 to 2019 that are tied to the Census Bureau decennial counts for 2010 and 2020. BEA developed intercensal population statistics because this data was not published when Census released county population data for 2020 through 2023, which are based on the 2020 decennial counts. BEA used the Census Bureau Das Gupta method (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/intercensal/2000-2010-intercensal-estimates-methodology.pdf), modified to account for an extra leap year day, to produce the intercensal population figures that will be used until Census releases its official intercensal population data."
